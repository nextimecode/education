## Preparing a Pull Request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/website.git
cd website
git remote add upstream https://github.com/radix-ui/website.git
```

1. Synchronize your local `main` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

1. Install dependencies with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn install
```

1. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b my-bug-fix
```

6. Make changes, then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

7. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/radix-ui/website) and [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

8. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

## Working locally

### Development

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# start the local server and see the site in your browser
yarn dev
```

Make your changes and check that they resolve the problem as expected.

Finally, run `yarn build` to ensure that the build runs successfully before submitting the pull request.
