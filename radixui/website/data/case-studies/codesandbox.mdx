  Radix has significantly improved the accessibility standard inÂ our components.
  We spend far less time discussing and implementing keyboard navigation, focus
  traps, and researching appropriate ARIA techniques for our components.

**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

We use Radix as the base for a number of our design system components. This design system is currently used in a beta project, though the intention is to expand it's use into our core product and marketing sites. 3 developers are responsible for maintaining the design system.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

Radix has significantly improved the accessibility standard in our components. We spend far less time discussing and implementing keyboard navigation, focus traps, and researching appropriate ARIA techniques for our components.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

I like that the component APIs provide a lot of flexibility, and allow us to create our own abstractions on top of the low-level Radix primitives. In our design system layer for example, we abstract away some of the options of the ContextMenu. This gives us a standardised ContextMenu built on top of Radix. In addition to intentionally restricting the API surface, we also apply styles to each of the Radix primitives and sub-components.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The Radix documentation is really great, and made it very easy for us to get started with the library. I specifically like that numerous examples are typically given for each component, and that in-development components are marked as "coming soon".

**How has Stitches improved your developer experience and/or app performance?**

Stitches has improved our developer experience by adding some type-safety to our styling. It has also made it very easy for us to implement theming across our site.
