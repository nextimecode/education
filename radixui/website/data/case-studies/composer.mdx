**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

We are building a web app using ClojureScript, Reagent (a React wrapper), Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Composerâ€™s design system is in its formative stage; we follow the atomic design methodology and strive to design reusable component patterns throughout the app.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

Being able to adopt Radix Primitives incrementally has been invaluable, helping us replace old components one at a time without any breaking changes.

The biggest win has been avoiding z-index wars since Radix manages all the stacking contexts with portals.

Radix has made our product significantly more accessible and reduced code complexity while allowing us to focus on building complex trading software.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

The DX is magical ðŸª„. Composing primitives to our preferences and styling them how we like with Tailwind is a breeze. We love that implementing a primitive feels as easy as implementing an HTML element but with 100x more flexibility.

We also appreciate that the team is always responsive on Discord and willing to help us through any roadblocks, especially because we use ClojureScript and have challenges that are unique to our language.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The documentation is straightforward and well-written, with realistic examples that make it easy to adopt a primitive. The beauty is that the concepts are relatively the same across the primitives, so you donâ€™t have to access the documentation frequently.
