# Balance

<Description>
  Testing lightness and saturation balance for Radix Colors
</Description>

## Lightness test

There are three categories of color: grays, colors, and bright colors. Within each section, all hues should be balanced across any given step. The colors are displayed in grayscale so we can focus on the lightness without being distracted by saturation.

<Note>
  **Note:** Some discrepancy is fine here—desired, even. Different hues
  naturally have different levels of chromatic intensity. Although it's good to
  keep hues balanced across, preserving some of the natural brightness curve can
  help the overall palette feel more natural.
