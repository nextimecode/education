# Styling

<Description>
  Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving
  you complete control over styling.
</Description>

## Styling overview

### Functional styles

You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a [Dialog Overlay](../components/dialog) won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.

### Classes

All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/accordion) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.

## Styling with CSS

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targeting the `className` that you provide.

```jsx line=3,7
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
import './styles.css';

const AccordionDemo = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item __className__="AccordionItem" value="item-1" />
    {/* … */}
  </Accordion.Root>
);

export default AccordionDemo;
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```css
.AccordionItem {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.AccordionItem[__data-state__='open'] {
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

## Styling with CSS-in-JS

The examples below are using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by wrapping it in a `styled` function (or equivalent).

```jsx line=5-7,11
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const StyledItem = __styled__(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',
});

const AccordionDemo = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <StyledItem value="item-1" />
    {/* … */}
  </Accordion.Root>
);

export default AccordionDemo;
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',

  '&[__data-state__=open]': {
    borderBottomWidth: '2px',
  },
});
```

## Extending a primitive

Extending a primitive is done the same way you extend any React component.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>((props, forwardedRef) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));
AccordionItem.displayName = 'AccordionItem';
```

## Changing the rendered element

All component parts that render a DOM element have an `asChild` prop. This is useful when you want a part to attach its accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element instead.

If you decide to change the underlying node rendered by Radix (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it is up to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.

Here's an example of how you can use a custom button called `MyButton` as the trigger for a `Dialog.Trigger`:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';
import { MyButton } from './my-button';

export default () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root>
      <Dialog.Trigger __asChild__>
        <MyButton>Open dialog</MyButton>
      </Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Content>...</Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  );
};
```

## Summary

Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.

For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.
